####SVG Icon Assignment

*Using common knowledge from other courses to create an HTML market page for a 
thematic set of **icons**. 
Using Illustrator, created twelve individual icons (same theme), and inserted them
into an HTML marketing like page.
**It was a requirement to use JavaScript to make element names responsive in the console
window, and to have elements show that they are or have been selected with JavaScript.***
SVG files are in the assets folder, and all JavaScript pertaining to the SVG's are located **directly** in the SVG file.
